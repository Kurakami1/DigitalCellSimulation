### **Step 3: Initiate DNA Synthesis**

1. Activate DNA polymerase and replication machinery.
2. Monitor DNA integrity and replication progress using fluorescence imaging.
3. Ensure replication errors are minimized; correct if possible using repair enzymes.

---

### **Step 4: Protein Synthesis**

1. Activate ribosomes and transcription machinery.
2. Introduce mRNA templates or synthesized genetic material.
3. Verify protein production via fluorescent markers or biochemical assays.
