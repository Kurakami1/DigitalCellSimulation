# # Digital Cell Simulation

## Overview
This repository presents a digital simulation of a perfect eukaryotic cell and its development into a multicellular organism. It models metabolism, protein synthesis, cell division, and differentiation in a fully digital environment with automated error correction, ensuring safe experimentation.

## Objectives
- Create a self-sustaining digital cell.  
- Simulate energy metabolism and protein synthesis with high fidelity.  
- Develop multicellular systems with tissues and organs.  
- Maintain system-wide homeostasis and error control.

## Key Features
- Accurate environmental parameters (temperature, pH, ions, glucose, oxygen).  
- Complete cell structure: membrane, nucleus, mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, lysosomes.  
- ATP balance and controlled energy flow.  
- High-fidelity protein synthesis (<0.01% error).  
- Controlled cell division and differentiation.  
- Multicellular tissue and organ formation.

## Call for Collaboration
Open for researchers and synthetic biology enthusiasts to explore and extend safely. Fully digital, no physical experiments involved.
